# MP3-Tag-Reader-and-Editor
This project is a Command-Line MP3 Tag Reader and Editor written in C. It allows users to view and modify ID3v2 tags (Title, Artist, Album, Year, Genre, Comment) of MP3 files directly from the terminal.  The tool parses the MP3 file structure, reads its metadata frames, and enables editing specific tags by updating the frame values inside the file.
